339 Nested List Weight Sum

List<T> list

get it's length by calling

list.size()



what is a good recursion?

main just call it, all things handled by helper()

for (each) can handle

size() == 0 or list == null;



        for (NestedInteger x : nestedList) {
            if (x != null) {
            }
        }
