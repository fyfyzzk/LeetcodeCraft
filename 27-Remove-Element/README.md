Cost 2.5 hr.
It costs me a lot of time for corner case
[4, 5] 4
[1] 3
[1] 1

But to solve corner case, I know further about how to include the case in the normal process.
I changed the startIndex != endIndex to startIndex < endIndex
then   startIndex <= endIndex to fit only 1 element in the input array.
